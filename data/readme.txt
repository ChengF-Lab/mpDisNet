disease-miRNA-gene: network dataset 
	(disease.id: name and id of diseases
	gene.id: name and id of genes
	mirna.id: name of miRNAs
	disease-mirna:the association between disease and miRNA
	mirna-gene:the association between miRNA and gene
	disease-gene : the association between disease and gene)


mpDisNet similarity_dggd: The similarity between diseases obtained by selecting the meta-path 'dggd' in the disease-gene network.

mpDisNet similarity_dmggmd: The similarity between diseases obtained by selecting the meta-path 'dmggmd' in the disease-miRNA-gene network.

mpDisNet similarity_dggd-dmggmd: The similarity between diseases obtained by combining the meta-path 'dggd' and 'dmggmd' in a comprehensive network of disease-miRNA-gene and disease-gene constructs.

Simple overlap. similarity: The similarity obtained by simple overlap calculation in a disease-miRNA network.
